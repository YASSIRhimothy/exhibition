  <h1>Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Page</h1>
  <h2>What are some of the challenges AI has to go through while providing information, making decisions, editing
    videos, learning e.t.c.?</h2>
  <p>A challenge A.I. has to go through while providing information, making decisions, editing videos, learning, and
    many more, is biasness. The automation of human decision-making is often justified by an alleged lack of bias in
    A.I. and algorithms. This belief is unsustainable; A.I. systems unavoidably make biased decisions.</p>
  <h2>What are some of the dangerous features of AI?</h2>
  <p>Some of the dangerous features of A.I. are:
  <ul>
    <li>Automation and repetitive job loss:AI is starting to take over jobs that follow a specific pattern or sequence
      or are repetitive because they tend to do these jobs faster and more accurately than humans </li>
    <li>Deepfakes: A deepfake is a video of a person being digitally changed, so that they can appear as someone else,
      say something differently or act differently. These videos are mostly used to spread false information. These
      videos are mostly used in celebrity videos, fake news, bullying, financial fraud, and more.</li>
    <li>Algorithm bias caused by bad data:Algorithm bias caused by bad data occurs when systematic errors of different
      machines make biased or favorited outputs. Some examples of algorithm bias are racial, socioeconomic, and gender
      biases. Algorithm bias is especially concerning when found within AI systems that support life-altering decisions
      in areas such as healthcare, law enforcement, and human resources.</li>
    <li>Manipulation of Information</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity Threats: Bad actors can force AI to launch cyberattacks. They manipulate AI tools to clone voices,
      generate fake identities and create convincing phishing emails(the fraudulent practice of sending emails or other
      messages purporting to be from reputable companies in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information,
      such as passwords and credit card numbers) - all with the intent to scam, hack, steal a person's identity or
      compromise their privacy and security.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Current Situations</h2>
  <p>Currently, AI has become a technological reality for businesses and organisations across the world. 
AI has proven itself capable of improving process efficiency, reducing human errors, labor, driving, medical diagnosis, extracting insights from big data, and many more. 
</p>

  <h2>What is AI?</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines that can mimic human intelligence like learning, reasoning, and
    problem-solving.
  <h2>Types of AI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Narrow AI</li>
    <li>General AI</li>
    <li>Superintelligent AI</li>
    <li>Weak AI</li>
    <li>Strong AI</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
  <p>AI is used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
  <h2>Future of AI</h2>
  <p>The future of AI includes advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

    <li>Reactive Machines</li>
    <li>Limited Memory</li>
    <li>Theory of Mind</li>
    <li>Self-Aware AI</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>AI in Everyday Life</h2>
  <p>AI is present in our daily lives through virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and smart home devices.</p>
  <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
  <p>As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations such as privacy, bias, and job displacement become increasingly
    important.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to transform various industries and improve our daily lives.</p>
