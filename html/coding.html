      <h1>Welcome to the Coding Page</h1>
      <p>
        Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers using
        programming languages.
      </p>

      <h2>What is coding</h2>
      <p>
        Coding is a way of giving instructions to a computer so it knows what to
        do. Just like we use language to talk to each other, we use special
        computer languages to "talk" to computers. These instructions can tell the
        computer to do all sorts of things—like showing a website, playing a
        video, or solving a math problem. Coding helps us create the apps, games,
        and programs we use every day. It’s kind of like writing a recipe: you
        give the computer a list of steps to follow, and if everything is written
        correctly, it will do exactly what you asked.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is coding important</h2>
      <p>
        Coding is important because it helps us tell computers what to do. We use
        coding to make video games, apps, websites, and even robots work! When you
        learn to code, you get better at solving problems and thinking in smart
        ways. It’s like learning a new language that lets you create cool things
        with technology. Coding is also fun because you can build your own games
        or projects and share them with others. In the future, knowing how to code
        can help you do lots of exciting jobs too!
      </p>

      <h2>How to start coding</h2>
      <p>
        To start coding, you can choose a simple programming language like Scratch
        or Python. Scratch is great for beginners because it uses blocks that you
        can snap together to create your own games and stories. Python is also
        easy to learn and is used by many people to make websites and apps. You
        can find lots of free online tutorials and games that teach you how to
        code step by step. Just remember, the most important thing is to have fun
        and not be afraid to make mistakes. Every coder started as a beginner,
        just like me!
