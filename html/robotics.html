  <h2>What are Robots?</h2>
  <p>Robots are programmable machines that can perform tasks either autonomously or with guidance.</p>


  <h2>Applications of Robotics</h2>
  <p>Robots are used in various fields such as manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration.</p>
  <h2>Future of Robotics</h2>
  <p>The future of robotics includes advancements in AI, machine learning, and human-robot collaboration.</p>
  <h2>Current Situation</h2>
  <p>There are approximately 50 robots produced in Kenya. In Kenya there are some robotics clubs in Mombasa. There is a
    robotics club called young engineers. I used to be a member. We would make cool robots. I once tried to make a car
    that could drive on a thin rail but unfortunately it broke. I know that our school has robotics as a club but not as
    a lesson. There are also robotics clubs in other schools. Robotics is being integrated into the C.B.C school
    curriculum.</p>
  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p>Here are some great resources to learn more about robotics:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.robotics.org/">Robotics Online</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.robotshop.com/en/robotics.html">RobotShop</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/robotics">edX Robotics Courses</a></li>
  </ul>


  </p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Here are some fun projects you can try:
  <ul>
    <li>Build a simple robot</li>
    <li>Create a robotic arm</li>
    <li>Develop a robot for a specific task</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <!-- List of Robot Types -->
